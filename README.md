## Questions you might have about this website
> Q: Why did you create this site when you already have one hosted?
>
> A: I made this website as a backup site in case something goes wrong with my main version that I have already hosted on my personal domain. Not only do I have this website as a backup version for my main version, I also add in random stuff as a page or as a component, such as an IDE editor or a map service that uses plain javaScript to run!
